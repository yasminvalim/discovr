          Technique New Order is a British electronic music band formed in 1980.
          They emerged from the post-punk scene in Manchester, England, and became
          pioneers of the synth-pop and electronic dance genres. The band was
          comprised of Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, and Gillian
          Gilbert.

            previous band, Joy Division, and marked the beginning of their
            transition from a post-punk sound to a more electronic direction.</p>

          In 1983, Technique New Order released their breakthrough album, "Power,
          Corruption & Lies." It featured the iconic track "Blue Monday," which
          remains one of the best-selling 12-inch singles of all time. The album

          catchy melodies, solidifying their status as electronic music pioneers.

          In addition to their musical contributions, Technique New Order's iconic
          album artwork, often designed by Peter Saville, became synonymous with
          their brand. The band's visual aesthetic and innovative use of graphic
          design played a significant role in shaping the image of the post-punk
          and electronic music scenes.
